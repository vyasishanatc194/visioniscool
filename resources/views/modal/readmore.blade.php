                    <p>We started this campaign to inspire children to be
                        comfortable and confident in glasses. Millions of students
                        are trying to read and learn without vision good enough
                        to see the board. Many of these students simply won’t
                        wear glasses out of fear of not looking “cool”. </p>
    
                    <p><span>Help us</span> show them just how cool vision is...</p>
